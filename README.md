# Capstone-Project
This study endeavors to construct predictive models for forecasting stock prices within the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, focusing on five diverse sectors: IT, steel, auto, banking, and FMCG. Incorporating data from two major indices, NIFTY and S&P 500. The analysis encompasses a comprehensive dataset spanning five years, from 2018 to 2022. The first three years' data (2018-2020) are dedicated to training the models, while the subsequent two years (2021-2022) are utilized for rigorous testing. Data points are collected at daily intervals to ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis process. Advanced deep learning architectures, including Long-and-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are employed to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the data. Both univariate and multivariate analyses are conducted to discern relevant factors influencing stock price movements across the selected sectors and indices. This research aims to challenge the efficient market hypothesis by demonstrating the feasibility of accurate stock price prediction despite market stochasticity. By meticulously designing models and selecting pertinent variables, the study endeavors to provide stakeholders with actionable insights for informed decision-making in stock trading and investment activities. The performance of each predictive model is thoroughly evaluated, considering factors such as prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Comparative analyses are conducted to assess the effectiveness of different model architectures and methodologies.
Ultimately, this research contributes to advancing the field of stock price forecasting within the NSE of India, offering valuable insights that can enhance risk management strategies and decision-making processes for market participants.
